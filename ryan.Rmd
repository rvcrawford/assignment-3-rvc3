* I am a technician who works at the amazingly-named Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences School of Integrative Plant Science Plant Breeding and Genetics Section--CUCALSSIPSPBG, for short.

* I have two kids, 5 years and 15 months old.

* I say that I like to read for pleasure but it takes me forever to finish anything.
